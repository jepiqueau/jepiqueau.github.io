<p>The purpose of this blog is to provide tutorials on how to use <strong><code>my own Capacitor Plugins</code></strong> for different application frameworks and device platforms.</p>

<ul>The list of my Capacitor Plugins includes:</ul>
<li>@capacitor-community/sqlite</li>
<li>@capacitor-community/photoviewer</li>
<li>capacitor-video-player</li>
<li>capacitor-data-storage-sqlite</li>

The blog is designed primarily for beginners who begin using plugins.
Due to their lack of understanding of the provided documentation or application links, they are generating a lot of issues and discussions.

I will focus on a first go to the plugin with a very broad audience. It's a challenging task to accomplish. My preference is to dedicate my free time to actual plugin maintenance.
