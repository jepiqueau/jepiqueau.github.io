<p>The purpose of this blog is to provide tutorials on how to use <strong><code>my own Capacitor Plugins</code></strong> for different application frameworks and device platforms.</p>

<ul>The list of my Capacitor Plugins includes:</ul>
<li>@capacitor-community/sqlite</li>
<li>@capacitor-community/photoviewer</li>
<li>capacitor-video-player</li>
<li>capacitor-data-storage-sqlite</li>

The blog is designed primarily for beginners who begin using plugins.
Due to their lack of understanding of the provided documentation or application links, they are generating a lot of issues and discussions.

I will focus on a first go to the plugin with a very broad audience. It's a challenging task to accomplish. My preference is to dedicate my free time to actual plugin maintenance.

If you are interested in contributing by creating new tutorials, feel free to do so. You are welcome. Please create a PR and I will merge it.
